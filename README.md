## 🧠 How It Works
1. The game generates a random sequence of colors.
2. You must repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
3. Each level adds a new random color to the sequence.
4. One wrong click and it’s game over!

- Implementing game logic and state management
- Enhancing UX with sound and animations
- Debugging logic errors and working with arrays

## 💡 Future Improvements
